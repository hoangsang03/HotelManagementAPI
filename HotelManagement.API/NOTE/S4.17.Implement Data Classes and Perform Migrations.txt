What you must know:
1. What is Ilist in C#
2. What is Virtual in C#

What I do in this PR:
1. turn off checking nullable value
2. create two entities, one is Hotel and another is Country
	1 Country can have many hotels

Install dotnet-ef 
references: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet#installing-the-tools

What issues I met:
1. Cannot install dotnet-ef because i have before and I must delete that folder and install 
again with specific version (because latest version is not compatible with .net version)

command: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 7.0.14

it should have same version as Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58764322/cannot-install-dotnet-ef-tool-on-windows-10

useful command:
list all tools: dotnet tool list --global
install dotnet-ef: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version xxx (omit version mean install latest)
update dotnet-ef tool: dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
